        <h2>
            CHAPTER I - Down the Rabbit-Hole
        </h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
                once or
                twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
                it, “and what
                is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
            </p>

            <p>
                So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy
                and stupid),
                whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
                daisies, when
                suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
            </p>

            <p>
                There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear
                the Rabbit
                say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to
                her that
                she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit
                actually took
                a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
                for it
                flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
                watch to take
                out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in
                time to see it
                pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
            </p>

            <p>
                In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out
                again.
